<p id="aboutme">Hi! I’m Eman Mahfooz, a passionate and aspiring Computer Science undergraduate at PIEAS University, expected to graduate in 2028. With a growing interest in Web Development, I’m continuously learning and refining my skills to build meaningful digital experiences.

My ambition is to transform my passion into a profession, showcasing my abilities through real-world projects, contributing to the tech community, and eventually earning through freelance opportunities. I strive to make a positive impact not only in my field but also in the lives of those who’ve supported me. It is my deepest desire to make my parents and loved ones proud through dedication, hard work, and continuous growth.
